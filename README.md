# Decrypt [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ghlens/Decrypt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ghlens/Decrypt)

This small python script was made to learn a bit about Python programming.
The script randomly tries to match the input. This gives the illusion of decrypting the data.

Usage `python textDecrypt.py "text"`
